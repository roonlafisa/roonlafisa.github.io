  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>I was born and grew up in Bangladesh.  
    I moved to Canada in 2014 to pursue my passion for RF systems and joined UBC for masters studies. 
    Since defending my thesis in 2016, I have been working in the space industry to develop complex sub-systems. Progressively, I have developed more and more passion for space technology and innovation. </p>
