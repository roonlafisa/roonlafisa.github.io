    <h1>An In-depth Look at IX Industrial Connectors</h1>
  </header>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Many users have experienced issues with the RJ45 connector due to its lack of robustness, including broken locking tabs and occasional contact problems. The IX Industrial connector provides a miniaturised, more reliable alternative to the RJ45. It conforms to the IEC 61076-3-124 standard and is manufactured by Harting.</p>

  <h2>Features of IX Industrial Connectors</h2>
  <p>The IX Industrial connector offers several important features:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Ethernet interface in the IP20 environment</li>
    <li>Ethernet 6A performance for 1/10 Gbit/s Ethernet</li>
    <li>70% less installation space compared to typical RJ45 sockets</li>
    <li>Continuous 360Â° shield design for high EMC immunity to interference</li>
    <li>Available in two types: Type A (Cat6A Ethernet) and Type B (signal and bus communication)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Industrial Use in Harting's 8-Port Industrial Switch</h2>
  <p>Harting's 8-port ethernet switch, Ha-VIS eCon 2080GX-I-AW, utilizes IX Industrial connectors. Thanks to the 70% smaller size of these connectors, the switch is more compact, lightweight, and robust. Find out more about this switch on Harting's website and Newark.</p>
