	<h3>About Me</h3>
	<p>I have been working in the space Industry for over five years with a thirst to learn new things every day. 
        I am experienced in designing end-to-end RF systems for satellite and rocket communication. 
        More recently, I have led the design and development of a full-stack (design to assembly) avionics system for an orbital-scale rocket.
	
	<p>This "webcite", is a wall to cited my professional experience.
