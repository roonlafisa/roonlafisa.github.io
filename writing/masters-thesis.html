    <h1>An In-depth Look at MIL-Spec Connectors - D38999 Series III</h1>
  </header>

  <h2>Introduction to MIL-Spec Connectors</h2>
  <p>A MIL-Spec connector offers two crucial features:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Air Seal:</strong> The connector is designed to prevent air infiltration, which can bring in moisture leading to corrosion. This feature also protects against the corrosive effect of Ozone on the crimps.</li>
    <li><strong>Magnetic Permeability:</strong> In situations where cables are adjacent to a bundle of wire producing an AC signal, the signal may get carried through the cable. To prevent this, MIL-Spec connectors offer high magnetic permeability and are primarily made from materials such as aluminium instead of steel or iron.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>About D38999 Series III</h2>
  <p>MIL-DTL-38999 connectors, available in four series: Series I, II, III, and IV, are renowned for their environmental resistance. They utilize removable crimp contacts and offer an operational temperature range of -65 to +200Â°C. The Series III, in particular, is preferred for Military and Aerospace applications due to its exceptional performance in extreme conditions such as high temperatures, moisture, wind, and vibrations.</p>

  <h2>Part Number Selection for D38999 Series III</h2>
  <p>Selection of the part number for the D38999 Series III involves several steps:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Select Shell Type:</strong> Series III has shell type identifiers 20, 21, 23, 24, 25, 27 for different receptacle styles, and 26 for plugs.</li>
    <li><strong>Select Material and Finish:</strong> Different identifiers are used to specify the material and finish type such as F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, S, T, W, Y, Z. </li>
    <li><strong>Select Shell Size:</strong> D38999 connectors are available in 9 shell sizes, identified by: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and J.</li>
    <li><strong>Select Insert Arrangement:</strong> Each shell size has a set of inset arrangements, for instance, size A has 2 insert arrangement options while size J has 12.</li>
    <li><strong>Select Contact Type:</strong> Besides the standard pins (P) and sockets (S), there are other identifiers for sealed and hermetic contacts.</li>
    <li><strong>Select Keying Position:</strong> There are six distinct keying positions available for each shell size in the D38999 series of connectors: N, A, B, C, D, and E. The keying position is indicated by the last letter in the part number.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Assembly Instructions for D38999 Series III</h2>
  <p>Correct assembly of these connectors requires a few steps:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Wire Stripping:</strong> Strip wire to the required length and twist strands together to form a firm bundle.</li>
    <li><strong>Contact Crimping:</strong> Insert stripped wire into contact crimp pot and use the correct crimp tool and locator to ensure the indentors are open.</li>
    <li><strong>Contact Insertion:</strong> After crimping, insert the contact into the connector using an insertion tool, ensuring proper alignment and seating.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>MIL-Spec "Equivalent" Connectors</h2>
  <p>In addition to MIL-Spec connectors, some manufacturers produce "equivalent" connectors. These connectors mimic the form factors and ruggedness of the MIL-Spec designs, although they may not adhere strictly to MIL-Spec standards. Major manufacturers such as TE Connectivity, Cinch, and Glenair produce these equivalent connectors under various product families.</p>

  <h2>Resources</h2>
  <p>For a comprehensive guide on D38999 Series III connectors, refer to the Federal connectors guide. A glossary can help you understand industry-specific terminology, and instructional videos can guide you on crimping procedures and best practices.</p>
