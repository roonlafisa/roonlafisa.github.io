    <h1>An Introduction to MIL-Spec Connectors - D38999 Series III</h1>
  </header>

  <h2>Introduction to MIL-Spec Connectors</h2>
  <p>A MIL-Spec connector is designed to prevent air infiltration, which can bring in moisture leading to corrosion. Additionally, these connectors offer high magnetic permeability to minimize signal interference in close proximity to AC signal cables. To achieve these properties, MIL-Spec connectors are primarily made from materials such as aluminium instead of steel or iron.</p>

  <h2>About D38999 Series III</h2>
  <p>MIL-DTL-38999 connectors are available in four series: Series I, II, III, and IV. These connectors are renowned for their environmental resistance, utilizing removable crimp contacts and offering an operational temperature range of -65 to +200Â°C. The Series III is the most preferred for Military and Aerospace applications due to its suitability in harsh conditions such as high temperatures, moisture, wind, and vibrations.</p>

  <h2>Part number selection for D38999 Series III</h2>
  <p>Selection of the part number for the D38999 Series III involves several steps, including selection of the shell type, material, finish, shell size, insert arrangement, contact type, and keying position. It is recommended to refer to the Federal connectors guide for a comprehensive understanding.</p>

  <h2>Assembly instructions for D38999 Series III</h2>
  <p>Correct assembly of these connectors requires tools like the DMC Crimping tool, Positioner, and Extraction tool. The assembly process involves stripping the wire to the required length, crimping the contact, and inserting the contact into the connector. Proper care must be taken during each of these steps to ensure a reliable connection.</p>

  <h2>MIL-Spec "Equivalent" Connectors</h2>
  <p>In addition to MIL-Spec connectors, some manufacturers produce "equivalent" connectors that mimic the form factors and ruggedness of the MIL-Spec designs. These are called "equivalent" because they are not made exactly to MIL-Spec standards but are similar in many ways. Major manufacturers like TE Connectivity, Cinch, and Glenair produce these equivalents in their respective product families.</p>

  <h2>Resources</h2>
  <p>For further information, you can refer to resources like Federal connectors for a comprehensive guide, a glossary to understand terminology, and instructional videos on crimping guidelines.</p>
