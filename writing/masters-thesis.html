  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>A broadband fixed-beam leaky-wave antenna is presented in this thesis. The proposed antenna consists of a graded dielectric superstrate placed on top of a closely-spaced thin slot array. The graded dielectric superstrate is designed using transformation electromagnetics to couple the radiation from underlying leaky slot-line into free space. Wave propagation in graded dielectric media, properties of leaky-wave antennas, and conformal transformation electromagnetics have been explored prior to the design. The behavior of the proposed antenna has been subsequently improved through developing a technique that exploits transformation electromagnetics. The technique adjusts the discrepancy in phase produced as a result of coordinate stretching at the boundary of transformed medium. Full-wave simulations are carried out to demonstrate the performance of the leaky-wave antenna. Broadband radiation characteristics are achieved from the antenna with peak radiation around 33⁰, 30% side-lobe level, 53% back-lobe level, 30.6⁰ beamwidth, and 11.8 directivity. Such performance makes the antenna suitable for planar applications where a fixed oblique beam is required over a broad bandwidth.</p>

  <h2>Summary of Work</h2>
  <p>Leaky-wave antennas are known to have wide input impedance bandwidth; however, their emitted beam scans with frequency variations. Chapter 1 raised a question of whether or not an obliquely radiating fixed-beam leaky-wave antenna can be designed for broadband applications. This question has been addressed through the development of this thesis. A leaky-wave antenna is proposed in this work that eliminates the conventional beam scanning performance while maintaining its wide input impedance. The antenna consists of a graded dielectric superstrate placed on top of a slot array. The superstrate functions as a transition layer to couple the slot-generated leaky wave radiation into free space. The radiation mechanism of previously proposed leaky-wave antennas has been presented in Ch. 2. Broadband fixed-beam radiation from leaky-wave antennas has received less attention as compared to conventional beam-scanning characteristics. The first fixed-beam leaky-wave antenna was implemented by a dielectric lens to generate particularly broadside radiation. Oblique radiation from this antenna can be achieved by simply tilting the antenna structure. However, the lens structure of the antenna made it electromagnetically large which is unsuitable for planar applications. In another planar approach, fixed-beam radiation was achieved using non-foster circuits. However, non-foster circuits have to be implemented using active elements which increases the power consumption of the overall structure. The project reflected in this thesis directed towards the design of a planar fixed-beam broadband leaky-wave antenna. As presented in Ch. 2, an infinitely long slot aperture located at the interface of two different dielectric half-spaces produces leaky-wave mode along the slot-line. The propagating mode generated leaky wave radiation which, in contrast to conventional one, remained constant with the change of operating frequency. The properties of the generated radiation were characterized as a function of different slot-width and dielectric materials. A leaky-wave antenna was designed with a simple 1D graded index material superstrate. A 1D dielectric distribution was not sufficient enough to provide an agreeable broadband antenna performance. The method was implemented on the rectangular superstrate to design the desired fixed-beam wide-band leaky-wave antenna. The design process is presented in Ch. 5. Simulation results presented in the same chapter demonstrate how the antenna radiation improves by applying the proposed technique. The slot-line leaky-wave antenna is capable of radiating at a fixed-angle, which is designed for a bandwidth of 123%. As compared to existing antennas, the proposed design consists of a slot-line array placed underneath an inhomogeneous superstrate, which is purely a passive device. To date, a number of transformation electromagnetics-based antennas have been proposed. The geometric compensation technique presented in this thesis opens the door for further improvement in antenna design inspired by transformation electromagnetics, in particular, lens antennas. In addition, the method can be applied to flat lenses where oblique radiation is required.</p>
